                                <p class="archiveText">She is a quiet, introspective witch who studies magic with patience and precision. Her enchanted camera was attuned to capture traces of arcane energy invisible to the naked eye, allowing her to document spell residues and rare magical phenomena. Over time, it became both her primary research tool and the archive of her discoveries.<br><br>
                                Years of exposure to powerful spells and unstable magic fields gradually corrupted its delicate mechanisms, distorting images before the device finally failed. She now seeks to repair it, hoping to recover the vital research and hidden knowledge stored within.
