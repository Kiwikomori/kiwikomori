# Out of Focus
Run a quaint camera repair shop tucked away in a secluded alleyway inside a magical fantasy world. Take on the role of a camera repair shop owner, restoring enchanted cameras that carry fragments of memories, spells, and untold stories. Experience interactive repairs, discover collectibles, and customers with distinct personalities and dialogue. 

The game blends cozy shop management with some character driven storytelling. The calming atmosphere encourages players to slow down, listen carefully, and piece together the lives connected to each camera.

# Design Process
This game was designed for players who enjoys puzzle solving, simple storytelling and a cozy gamimg experience over fast-paced and intense mechanics. So, the players that these would attract would be Free-Spirits and Achievers, where they are free to do anything with no time limit and also replay to get all the collectibles. 

We wanted to set the world in a magical fantasy vibe as it woud open up to a lot more possibilities with repairing cameras.

## Technologies Used
[Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API) - Used to make scenes appear on top of another (e.g. when opening drawers)

[model-viewer](https://modelviewer.dev) - Used to simplify importing a 3D Model as well as coding a interactive 3D Model viewing experience. (for the colletions page)


# Assistive AI

## Acknowledgements
At first we weren't sure if an escape room could even be coded. While looking through multiple inspirations, such as [Rusty Lake](rustylake.com/room-escape-games/). However, it wasn't enough because they made applications. We managed to come across an interesting article by [Daniel Marino](https://iamdanielmarino.com/posts/making-an-escape-room-with-only-html-and-css/) where he made an escape room using only HTML and CSS. We took inspiration of how they used invisible checkboxes and radio buttons to make everything work. Things were much easier with JavaScript.

We took various games as inspiration for the world building and animations, etc. such as [Bookbinding](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3555780/Bookbinding/), [Tavern Talk](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2076140/Tavern_Talk__A_Cozy_Visual_Novel/) and [Rusty Lake games](rustylake.com/room-escape-games/).
